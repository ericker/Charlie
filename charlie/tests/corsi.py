corsi: Tests of spatial memory span.

This is test shares some similarities with the original Corsi test [1]. On each
trial, the proband sees several randomly distributed non-overlapping squares
for 2 seconds. During the study period, circles or crosses appear in the
squares, and during the test period, the proband clicks on the squares that
contained the circles. There are three portions to the test. During the
'simultaneous' portion, all circles appear in the sqaures at once, and the
proband must report all of them, in any order. During the 'forward' portion,
the circles appear one by one, and the proband must report them in the correct
order. During the 'sequence' portion, circles and crosses appear in the
squares, and the proband must report the circles in order, then the squares in
order. Each portion contains practice and test trials. The number of circles/
crosses per trial starts at 2, and increases by 1 every three trials, up to
a maximum of 9. There are always twice as many squares as circles/crosses in a
trial.

Previous work has generally concluded that the reverse-reporting version of the
Corsi produces the same results as the forward-reporting version [2]. I found
the same thing when conducting pilot testing here. The three versions included
in the present version produced very different scores, with simultaneous being
the easiest and seqeunce being the most difficult.

Summary statistics:

    [portion]_* : simulaneous, forward, or sequence

    *ntrials : number of trials.
    *ncorrect : number of correct trials.
    *k : trial with largest number of circles/crosses correctly reported.
    *rt_mean : mean response time on correct trials in milliseconds.
    *rt_mean_outrmvd : as above, except any trials <> 3 s.d. of mean excluded.
    *rt_outrmvd : number of outlier trials.
