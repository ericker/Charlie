Continuous-performance test (practice)

In this test, you will see a row of three symbols
flash up in the middle of the screen. They will
stay for a moment and then will be replaced by
another three symbols. Your task is to press the
spacebar each time the row of symbols matches the
previous row exactly. If none of the symbols match,
or only one or two of them match, do nothing.

Press any key to begin try some practice trials.
