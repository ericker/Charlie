Word-learning test, part 3

Earlier, you learned some words. Now, you will hear
some more words. Some of these words you have already
heard and others are new. Respond 'Yes' if you heard
the word earlier, or 'No' if you did not. If you
are not sure, guess. Try to complete the task as
quickly as you can without making mistakes.
