Matrix-reasoning test (practice)

On each trial you will see a picture with a piece
missing from it. Your task is to look carefully
at the picture, and choose the missing piece from
the five alternatives that appear at the bottom
of the screen. There is only one correct choice
per picture. If you think that more than one
answer is correct, choose the one you think fits
best.
