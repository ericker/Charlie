Digitâ€”symbol test, part 1 (practice)

At the top of the screen you will see a row of
symbols and a row of digits. Each symbol is paired
with the digit below it.

You will also see one symbol and one digit in the
middle of the screen. Your job is to decide
whether they make a correct pair. Respond 'Yes' if
they do, and 'No' if they don't. Press any key to
try some practice trials.
