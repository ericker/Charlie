Test of emotion recognition

On each trial you will see an image of a person's
face. Your task is to judge how the person is
feeling by clicking on the correct word. They will
be either happy, sad, angry, afraid, or neutral (no
emotion). If you are not sure, guess. Try to
complete the task as quickly as you can without
making mistakes.
