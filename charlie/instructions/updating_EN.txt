Test of updating working memory (practice)

On each trial, you will see a grid with a circle
inside it, followed by a sequence or arrows and
dashes, followed by a new empty grid. The arrows
and dashes 'update' the position of the circle
within the grid: An arrow will move it up, down,
left or right one space, and a dash with keep it
in the same place. Your task is to click on the
space in the new grid where the circle should go.
