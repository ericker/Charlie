Test of facial memory, part 2

Earlier, you saw some faces. Now, you will see some
more faces. Some of these faces you have already
seen and others are new. Respond 'Yes' if you saw
the face earlier, or 'No' if you did not. If you
are not sure, guess. Try to complete the task as
quickly as you can without making mistakes.
