Stroop test (practice)

On each trial, you will see two images side by
side. Your job is to say which of the images is
smaller on the screen. Respond 'left' if the left-
hand image is smaller, and 'right' if the right-
hand image is smaller.

Press any key to begin some practice trials.

Stroop test (real thing)

Now you will perform the real test. It is the same
as the practice, except there are more trials, and
the images on each trial will depict two different
real-world objects. Your job is to say which image
is smaller on the screen, NOT which is smaller in
real life. Try to complete the task as quickly as
you can without making mistakes.

Press any key to begin.
