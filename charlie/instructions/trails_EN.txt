This test requires the experimenter to take over.

---
Number sequencing (examples)
---
Place the test form (Part A1), sample side up, flat on the table
in front of the proband and say this:

"On this page [point to the form] are some numbers.  Begin at
number 1 [point] and draw a line from 1 to 2 [point], then from
2 to 3 [point to 3], 3 to 4 [point to 4], and so on, in order,
until you reach the end [point to the end].  Draw the lines as
fast as you can, without lifting your pencil from the paper.
Ready? Begin."""

Correct and explain any errors. If the subject makes an incorrect
connection, mark the connection with an "X", explain the error
and ask the subject to continue from the last correctly connected
number. If the subject cannot complete the practice after 4
corrections by the examiner, discontinue.
---
Number sequencing (real thing)
---
Turn over the test form, and say this:

"On this page there are numbers from 1 to 25. Do this the same way.
Begin at number 1 [point] and draw a line from 1 to 2 [point], 2 to
3 [point], 3 to 4 [point], and so on in order, until you reach the
end [point to the end]. And remember to work as fast as you can.
Ready? Begin."
---
Letter sequencing (examples)
---
Place the test form (Part AA), sample side up, flat on the table
in front of the proband and say this:

"On this page [point to the form] are some letters.  Begin at
A [point] and draw a line from A to B [point], then from
B to C [point to C], C to D [point to D], and so on, in order,
until you reach the end [point to the end].  Draw the lines as
fast as you can, without lifting your pencil from the paper.
Ready? Begin."""

Correct and explain any errors. If the subject makes an incorrect
connection, mark the connection with an "X", explain the error
and ask the subject to continue from the last correctly connected
number. If the subject cannot complete the practice after 4

Turn over the test form, and say this:

"On this page there are numbers from A to Y. Do this the same way.
Begin at A [point] and draw a line from A to B [point], B to
C [point], C to D [point], and so on in order, until you reach the
end [point to the end]. And remember to work as fast as you can.
Ready? Begin."

Number-letter sequencing (examples)
---
Place the test form (Part AB), sample side up, flat on the table
in front of the proband and say this:

"On this page [point to the form] are some numbers and letters.
Begin at 1 [point] and draw a line from 1 to A [point], then from
A to 2 [point to 2], 2 to B [point to B], and so on, in order,
until you reach the end [point to the end].  Draw the lines as
fast as you can, without lifting your pencil from the paper.
