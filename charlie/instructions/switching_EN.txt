Task-switching test, part 1 (practice)

On each trial, you will see four squares with an
arrow in one of them. If the arrow is blue and in
one of the upper squares, you must indicate whether
its POSITION: Respond 'Left' if it is in the left-
hand square, and 'Right' if it is in the right-
hand square.

If the arrow is red and in the one of the bottom two
squares, you must indicate its DIRECTION: Respond
'Left' if it is facing left and 'Right' if it is
facing right.

Now you will perform the real test. It is the same
as the practice, except there are more trials. 

Notice that the task will switch predictably
every other trial. You will start with two trials
of the position task (blue arrows), then two trials
of the direction task (red arrows), then back to the
position task.

Try to complete the task as quickly as you can
without making mistakes.
