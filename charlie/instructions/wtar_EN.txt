Say this:

"I will show you some words that I will ask you to pronounce."

Place the WTAR Word card in front of the examinee.  As you point
to the card, say:

"Beginning with the first word on the list, pronounce each word
aloud. Start with the word (point to Item 1), and go down this
column, one right after the other, without skipping any.  When
you finish this column, go to the next column (point to the
second column).  Pronounce each word, even if you are unsure. Do
you understand?"

When you are sure that the examinee understands the task, say:

"Ready? Begin".
